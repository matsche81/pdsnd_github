### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis US-Cities

### Description
This is a tiny application to analyze bikeshare data of three US-Cities. Washington, Chicago, New York City.
The user will be prompted for which city he wants statistics to be displayed and for what timeperiod (e.g. month, weekday).
The application generates statistics about the most popular time of travel, about popular bikeshare stations, trip duration and of course user info if available. But feel free to customize and generate more statistics you consider to be important.
